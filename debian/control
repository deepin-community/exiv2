Description: EXIF/IPTC/XMP metadata manipulation tool
 Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command line utility to manage image metadata.
 It provides fast and easy read and write access to the Exif, IPTC and XMP
 metadata of images in various formats
 .
 Exiv2 command line utility to:
 .
  * print Exif, IPTC and XMP image metadata in different formats:
    - Exif summary info, interpreted values, or the plain data for each tag
  * set, add and delete Exif, IPTC and XMP image metadata from command line
    modify commands or command scripts
  * adjust the Exif timestamp (that's how it all started...)
  * rename Exif image files according to the Exif timestamp
  * extract, insert and delete Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata and JPEG comments
  * extract previews from RAW images and thumbnails from the Exif metadata
  * insert and delete the thumbnail image embedded in the Exif metadata
  * print, set and delete the JPEG comment of JPEG images
  * fix the Exif ISO setting of picture taken with Canon and Nikon cameras

Description: EXIF/IPTC/XMP metadata manipulation library
 Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command line utility to manage image metadata.
 It provides fast and easy read and write access to the Exif, IPTC and XMP
 metadata of images in various formats
 .
 Exiv2 library provides:
  * fast read and write access to the Exif, IPTC, and XMP metadata of an image
  * an easy to use and extensively documented API
  * conversions of Exif and IPTC metadata to XMP and vice versa
  * a smart IPTC implementation that does not affect data that programs like
    Photoshop store in the same image segment
  * Exif Makernote support:
    - Makernote tags can be read and written just like any other metadata
    - a sophisticated write algorithm avoids corrupting the Makernote
  * a simple interface to extract previews embedded in RAW images and Exif
    thumbnails
  * set and delete methods for Exif thumbnails
